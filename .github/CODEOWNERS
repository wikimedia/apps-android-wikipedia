To get started with GitHub Copilot, you can follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up for Copilot**:
   - You can begin with [Copilot Free](https://github.com/copilot?ref_cta=Copilot+free) to explore limited features without subscribing to a plan.
   - Alternatively, upgrade to Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ for access to advanced features, models, and higher usage limits. For more details, check out [plans for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot).

2. **Install and Enable Copilot in Your IDE**:
   - To use Copilot, ensure you have it installed in your development environment, such as Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, or others. See the [Quickstart for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/quickstart) for setup instructions.

3. **Start Using Copilot**:
   - Once installed, you can begin using Copilot in your code editor. It will provide real-time coding suggestions as you type.
   - You can also ask Copilot questions about your code, request explanations, or get assistance with debugging.

4. **Set Up Copilot for Learning (Optional)**:
   - If you're learning to code, you can configure Copilot to act as a tutor. Disable code completion temporarily and use it to ask conceptual questions. Learn more in [Setting up Copilot for learning to code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-to-code/setting-up-copilot-for-learning-to-code).

5. **Explore Advanced Features**:
